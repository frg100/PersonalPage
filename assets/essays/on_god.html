  <h1> On God </h1>

  <p> 
    I do think that some inherent ethereal being existed before or concurrently with this universe or maybe is this universe and created everything as we know it. There’s no explanation for what came before the initial inflationary period. There was a void and out of nothing quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field caused an initial inflationary bubble that then led to eternal inflation but physicists shy away from asking what came before. There’s no explanation but an inherent being that created everything and nothing. It is the alpha and omega. Is it necessitated that this being be the Catholic God? Absolutely not. Is it possible? Of course. The “unscientific” aspects of Christianity aren’t what bother me. As I explained, science supports, or at least doesn’t yet discount, the idea of an ethereal creationary being. What bothers me are three things: 1) God’s reliance on faith, 2) the problem of Evil, and 3) the apathy that  Christianity unfortunately spawns in lots of people.

      Why does a benevolent God require faith of us? This is an incredibly medeival and cruel concept that we refuse to let go of. I don’t think the Bible is the be-all and end-all. God is transient and exists through various time periods. The God that we’re presented with right now is outdated and anchored to the Dark Ages when the Church was king. This is why I greatly respect Pope Francis’ attempts at modernization of the Church. Back then it was necessary for a master to be feared and respected because they were fearful of losing their power. They could be the most benevolent masters possible, giving their servants an easy life and being kind and generous, but any disrespect was seen as ingratitude and a servant would be immediately disfavored. This is why the idea of God developed during the middle ages relied so much on faith. We need to be faithful and obedient and submissive to God so that he can then be benevolent. This is no longer the case, however. It is entirely possible to be faithful as a result of our gratefulness, not as proof of it. If God is really eternally benevolent he should be content with us humans being kind and generous to each other without believing in Him. If we treat everyone well and follow a Christian life then we should deserve to go to heaven as well. Why is a belief in the specific version of God: the christian God, necessary? Can’t a young child born in rural india who dies of disease at a young age go to heaven? Or does the fact that he was never exposed to God sentence him to eternal damnation? This is the idea of missions around the world; to educate these people and help them go to heaven, but there are still people who have never heard of God. God created them but God never gave them the opportunity to believe in him? This seems terribly unfair and is not in line with His principles. This is something that is still fought against by many christians around the world, however . Only recently has the Pope made attempts to explain that athesists can also go to heaven if they follow their conscience. This falls in line with a passage in the bible, Romans 2:14. “And the Law is written unto the heart of the gentiles”. According to this, God’s Law is written into our conscience and by following this conscience we can abide perfectly by the Law without having to believe in God and still go to heaven. With these sorts of interpretations it is fine to believe in the Christian God, but while most christians would agree with this, they still feel unsettled and fight back with “but without faith you can never actually go to Heaven”.

      Why are some people better off than others in this life? “Because that’s God’s plan for them” What about a young child born into poverty who dies at age 5 of malaria? “It’s a hard question with no easy answer but we cannot know the mysterious ways of the Lord. We just have to trust and have faith” What did I do better to deserve an affluent lifestyle? What did I do better to deserve a loving family? What did I do better to deserve not ever having to worry about having enough to eat? Many people lose faith in God because things aren’t going great in their life and they feel like God abandoned them. I struggle because of the exact opposite reason. My life is perfect and I hate it. I don’t want to be ungrateful but I can’t live with a clear conscience believing that I did something better than someone else and that’s why I’m the one getting served on a silver platter and not the one doing the serving. There are people who have such a strong faith in God and live off of less than a dollar a day, when I have a lukewarm faith and enjoy from anything that I could ever want. Theologians have spent the last two decades dealing with this problem and for a while I could live with it. Until I realized that the only reason I could live with it was because I was ignoring it, not living with a solution.

      Finally my last grievance with Christianity is the apathy that results from it. God’s Plan. Subject of a platinum record by the most popular artist in the world. It has been the go-to response to explain away anything unpleasant. “It’s all within God’s Plan”. Christians live under the idea that there’s some master plan that in the end will give them everything they ever wanted. Right now life sucks but later everything will be ok. “Everything happens for a reason”. This used to be what satiated my conscience and left me apathetic and lazy. Why would I change anything about my character if it’s God’s plan and he will help me improve. I made little to no effort to fix my negative traits because I was trusting in something that wasn’t there. For many people this trusting in God is a placebo that then helps them make the changes themselves. But for me and the majority of christians this just leads to apathy and a deferring of self-improvement. Now that I’m free of that crutch, that net on the edge of the cliff, I have a real and actual fear of my faults. I know that to fix them the motivation needs to come entirely from within and that fear is what pushes me to improve myself. Christianity can sometimes dangerously remove that fesr and lead to a dangerous apathy,

    What I have realized is that my conscience tells me that this is all wrong. It is the reason I have lost faith in christianity. It tells me that the teachings of the church are outdated and inconsistent with the idea of a benevolent God. I realize the logical paradox with the idea that my faith in my conscience comes from a passage in the outdated Bible but logical paradoxes seem to be at the very core of Christianity anyways. If I were to believe in God, I could say that my loss of faith is within His plan anyways and I am meant to be another prophet to help modernize the Church and discover the true God that only I can conceive of, the one my conscience tells me exists. But that is incredibly self-serving and I really can’t hold any claim to anything like that. If He does exist, I trust that he’ll show me the errors of my ways and I’ll finally see the light. I would absolutely love for that to happen. I was the happiest when I was a follower of Christ. Until I wasn’t. Until my conscience woke up and told me to get off my ass and start thinking for myself. Nietzsche is decried by religious thinkers everywhere as an usurper because he encourages people to challenge their assumptions. For him that leads to a negative opinion of Christianity but what I love about him is that, in theory, if your convictions are correct, they should withstand all introspection and criticism, both from within and without. Christianity hasn’t so far, but it might in the future. Only time will tell...
