  <h1> On Free Will </h1>

  <p>
    We are, probably, deterministic machines drifting aimlessly through spacetime, brought into conception by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-field-theory/">quantum fluctuations</a> in dozens of fields we can’t even yet prove exist. However, there remains an imperceptible repulsion inside all of us to that concept. Many take this to mean that we are relieved of all moral responsibility and others can take it as far as our not even needing to live. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> was a determinist, yet he believed that we could make what we call “choices”. We are still humans with an innate need to survive and an acute fear of death. He still presented his natural law philosophy in order to try to influence people to be more virtuous and improve the world. For some reason or other we feel happiness and fear pain. Just because we don’t fundamentally get to “decide” anything doesn’t mean we can’t act in ways that seem to be causally determined by what seem to be choices we make in order to be happy. This way of thinking implies a sort of trust in, or ignorance of/apathy towards, the inner workings of the world.

    Or maybe there is some emergent property of the human neural network that allows us some freedom of will. Many people refuse to believe that we have no choice in this world. A stubborn spirit of self-determination has become humanity’s defining quality. A housefly blindly flies around following its instincts but humans are different. This implies a gradient of freedom, however, with simple animals like houseflies having little to no freedom and humans capable of exercising free will. This is a seductive idea but there is no evidence for this apart from the hopeful ideas floating around in our head. Psychologists have shown that we are, in fact, predictably irrational. Our situation is a better explanation for our actions than our internal disposition, this is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">Fundamental Attribution Error</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Believers in free will see nonbelievers as hopeless pessimists and nonbelievers see believers as naïve and deluded, consuming the pornography that is the idea of free will. What side do you fall on? Most religious folk will insist that we have free will and many “educated” professionals will insist that free will is a delusion. Bet them $5 that they can’t give you a formal definition of free will, however, and you just won yourself a drink. “Free will is the ability to make your own decisions.” Is cognition free will? A robot is as capable of making decisions as we are. Yes, we programmed it, but out brains were programmed as well. It is entirely possible that our brains were designed by intelligent sentient beings 50,000 parsecs away. AI built on neural networks learn from associative experience and scientists have learned how to simulate the human brain; all we need is processing power. We live in a multiverse of inflationary bubbles with quantum fields stuck at different values. It is statistically necessitated that we exist, that the group of molecules that we are made up of. Out there there are similar if not exact copies of us.

    So what is the solution? I'm not really sure yet. This topic is a work in progress and I will keep revisiting it as I have more insights...
