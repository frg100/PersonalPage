  <h1> On Drugs and Alcohol </h1>

  <p> 
    What are my moral motivations for drinking/smoking? To have fun, loosen inhibitions, relax in being able to not worry about work. To an "ethical person" these don't seem to be great moral motivations, but we don't really have an obligation to live an ascetic lifestyle. So we must look at the costs. 
  </p>

  <div class=innerSection">
    <h2> Drinking </h2>

    <p> 
      With drinking there’s a risk of death via alcohol poisoning and addiction via prolonged exposure. As long as you are confident that you can reasonably avoid these, then there's no problem with drinking. Personally, I hate vomiting and over the past couple years of small exposure and controlled drinking with my parents, I know how to control myself so I don’t think I’m at a high enough risk of death to prevent me from ever drinking again. If there is a high enough chance of you dying because you know you cant control yourself then you should definitely stop drinking because it would be in violation of our primary motivation: avoiding death. There is also a risk of addiction, but if you're fairly certain you're not at risk, then drinking is ok. Personally, I do not feel any semblance of dependence at all on alcohol right now. That could change, however, but knowing myself and knowing my fears, I know that if I ever feel myself start to become in any level dependent on alcohol I’ll get frightened and stop. This is a more slippery slope because it relies more heavily on <a href="./a_theory_of_motivation.html">self-control</a>. However, if I properly activate a higher motivation as I have taught myself to do with practice, then I feel safe and condfident that, for the moment, I am ok with drinking.

    <h2> Smoking </h2>

    <p>
      Some of the risks of smoking mariguana include damaging and/or incapacitating your lungs and having a bad reaction to the drug. Some of that risk can be reduced by only consuming non-vaporized mariguana (edibles), but there's still the risk of addiction. It’s unlikely you’ll get addicted on the first time you try it so that is acceptable but your likelihood of addiction and thus your moral disapproval should go up the more you use it until a point where you’ll need to stop completely. This is another self-judgement call relying on <a href="./a_theory_of_motivation.html">self-control</a>, however, so we need to be careful.
    </p>

    <h2> Other Drugs </h2>

    <p>
      Most other drugs are much more intense than alcohol or mariguana in either their risk of death/bodily harm (hallucinogens), or in their risk of addiction (nicotine, heroine, cocaine) that it isn't worth it to even try them.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Overall the question to ask here do these things inhibit your success in the world? If you’re not at risk of death then no. If you’re at risk of addiction then yes. In general the first time there’s no moral disapproval but each successive time the risk of addiction increases along with the moral disapproval.
